# Hothouse DSP Pedal Kit

The Hothouse is a compact pedal kit for the Electrosmith Daisy Seed. You can use it to easily get your Daisy Seed DSP projects off the breadboard and onto your pedalboard, either by compiling and flashing any of the code in [the official repository](https://github.com/clevelandmusicco/HothouseExamples), or by using the Daisy Web Programmer with the pre-compiled binaries. And of course, you can also write your own DSP code for the Hothouse. Basically, anything that runs on the Daisy Seed will run on the Hothouse.

These are the open source hardware files for the Cleveland Music Co. Hothouse DSP Pedal Kit. Included are the required gerber, BOM, and CPL files required to fabricate the boards at JLCPCB.

>[!NOTE]
> No step-by-step tutorial for having the boards fabricated is provided. It's assumed that anyone interested in using these files is already familiar with the fabrication process.
